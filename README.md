This project was focused on enhancing my skills in jQuery and JavaScript. It provided a valuable opportunity to work with the jQuery framework and expand my knowledge in this area.

Through jQuery, I gained proficiency in accessing elements without relying heavily on direct DOM manipulation. jQuery simplified the process by allowing me to utilize its functions and methods to interact with elements more efficiently. Additionally, jQuery provided alternatives to traditional event listeners, enabling me to streamline my code.

Overall, this project was instrumental in my journey to master jQuery and further strengthen my JavaScript skills.

It requires a keyboard to start the game.
